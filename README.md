## Super simple thumbnail generator for my YouTube videos.

Requires imagemagick and ffmpeg to be installed. You probably also need the Helvetica-Bold font. Just tweak the script if it doesn't work!

Usage: `./thumbgen <video file> <your title string>`

Example: `./thumbgen my_cool_vid.mkv Integrating a flux capacitor into our time machine!`
